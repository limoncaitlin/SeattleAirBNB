# Seattle AirBNB

# Installations:
This project was done in the Anaconda environment with python 3.6. The following packages were used:
- datetime
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- seaborn
- sklearn
- tqdm

# Motivation
I completed this project as a requirement for the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree. I used Seattle AirBNB data and sought to answer three questions about AirBNBs in Seattle:
1. What is the peak season in Seattle as determined by price and listing availability?
2. What factors affect listing price, as determined by a linear regression model?
3. Which neighborhoods in Seattle have the best reviews on average?

# Files
The SeattleData.ipynb file contains the jupyter notebook used to perform this analysis and modeling. The data files used are calendar.csv, listings.csv, and reviews.csv. The file names are pretty self-explanatory. The calendar csv contains information on booking dates and availability. The listings csv contains all of the listings in Seattle with information about each, like number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and amenities. The reviews csv contains all of the review given by customers that visited each listing. These files are publicly available on Kaggle.

# Results
The results of this project are available at the medium post I authored. 

# Acknowledgements
